# Aggreagtor project

This is the code for the Aggregator component for the project on Cloud Based Web Technologies in CCT Dublin.

## Considerations

Remember the port of this application is 8081 instead of 8080. This is done to avoid a class when you are running
the UTCDate service in your own machine.

In order to run it:
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Remember, if you are in Windows, you need to change the `./mvnw` part to match your interpreter (can be `.\mvnw`)
